In the previous section, we spent some time considering how our course would be structured. It is now time to start planning the design of our course.  Critical to this process, is understanding "where" we want students to end up. Once we have a sense of our end-goal, we can start developing a plan of how we can guide the students to get there.

One effective framework that instructors can use is called backwards design.

### Backwards Design Framework

Quite simply, the big idea with backwards design is to plan with the end in mind.  Working backwards is not a novel idea created only within the confines of education; you may be familiar with it in terms of goal setting, narrative writing, strategic planning, or even cooking.  Cookbooks have beautiful photographs of food so that you can see what the recipe is instructing you towards.  In their book, *Understanding by Design*, Wiggins and McTighe (1998) provide a detailed framework for teaching with the end in mind. They suggest that in order for students to gain understanding, learning needs to be meaningful and relevant.  Backwards design is their framework to accomplish this.

So how do you start at the end?  Consider what do you hope your students will be able to do, know and/or be by the end of your course or unit.  Wiggins and McTighe provide this sentence start to help prompt instructors:

> Students will be able to independently use their learning to...

Though thinking about the end goal may be straightforward enough, one important aspect to consider is endurance.  Will the learning stick? Will it be meaningful? Will students still be able to do/know/be one year after the course? What about five years or ten years from it?  Thinking long term helps to focus your teaching efforts and your students' learning efforts on goals that will stand the test of time.  Many educators refer to these as *enduring understandings*.

Now hang on, you might ask, 'What if my course already has learning outcomes that I can't change?  Then the backwards design work is already done for me, right?'  Not quite.  Using backwards design is a shift in perspective.  I'm not focused on teaching the content, but I'm using content to help students learning meaningfully and reach the enduring understandings for the course or unit.  Focusing on the goals ensures that your learning plan is headed in the right direction.  It's like figuring out the how your detective character solves the crime puzzle before you start writing the introduction to your mystery novel.

The basics of Wiggins and McTighe's backwards design framework can be broken down into a three step process:

1. Establish learning goals/enduring understandings

    What do you hope your students will be able to do, know and/or be by the end of your course or unit ?

2. Design assessments that will measure the intended goals

    How will you know that students have learned what you want them to learn?  What evidence do you need?

3. Plan learning activities that will instruct students to attain the goals

    What will help them gain understanding and complete the assessments?

Again, notice the order.  We're not starting with what content or textbook or activity to use, but with figuring out my desired outcome for the students.

This component of the design process is incredibly important as it helps use develop a "map" of the course. In our next section, we will introduce a resource that you can use to help "map" out your ideas as you work through the backwards design framework.
