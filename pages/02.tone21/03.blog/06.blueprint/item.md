!!!! :fa-calendar: Reminder of our bi-weekly Zoom meeting for TOnE21 coming up this Friday, February 26 at 11:00 AM. [Check Moodle for the Zoom link.](https://learn.twu.ca)  

So far, we have explored some important ideas to consider as you think about how to structure your course. We have also considered the process of designing the course. Now that we have an understanding of these two components of course design, we can get started on the *actual* design of the course.

Effective course design requires careful planning and preparation. It is critical that the learning outcomes align with the content and, ultimately, align with the assessments. A well designed course should also include learning activities that allow students to explore the content and practice applying what they have learned. While integrating each of these elements can seem overwhelming, the design process relies on an important resource to help plan the development of creating an effective course: *The Blueprint.*

### The Blueprint

When you hear the word *blueprint*, you may associate it with *planning* or *framework.* As a scholar and active researcher, you undoubtedly recognize the importance of selecting a theoretical framework in which to situate your work. Grant and Osanloo write, "Without a theoretical framework, the structure and vision for a study is unclear, much like a house that cannot be constructed without a blueprint. By contrast, a research plan that contains a theoretical framework allows the study to be strong and structured with an organized flow from one [section] to the next" (2014, p. 13).

To unpack the significance of the blueprint in a construction context, we consulted Rick Olsen of RTZ Construction, a home builder and carpenter with over 30 years of experience. As you read through his comments, reflect on possible parallels between home building and the course design process.

> **Q: What is the role of a blueprint in the building and design process?**

> A: In my trade, the role of a blueprint is the start of everything. You need to build a house with the foundation first. Once you start with that, you build all the infrastructure and framing, then finish with the "jewelry," so to speak. Blueprints are the first thing. You have to start with the blueprint and detail it out the best you can to prepare for the actual build.

> **Q: What are the implications of building a house without a blueprint?**

> A: *(chuckles)* Well, there's no such thing as building a house without a blueprint. It just doesn't happen. You need a plan. To execute a plan properly, you need to have detailed designs and a process to start with. If you don't, you're going to be over budget, it's going to be built wrong, and, structurally, you won't have a securely built building.

> **Q: As the project unfolds, is there room to revise the blueprint?**

> A: Yes. Once you have the "bones" of the blueprint and the actual structure designed, there is always time to change things if you haven't reached the point of no return in the project. If your foundation is set and the structure is in place, you can't really change either of those, but you can change the interior walls here and there. You can change the flooring, lighting, fixtures, things like that. As long as the foundation is put in properly and the actual structure is built properly, then everything else is flexible.

Olsen clearly outlines the foundational role of a blueprint in the overall home building and design process. It seems unlikely that any of us would agree to take part in a home building project without a solid blueprint in place, but how often do we start a new semester without taking the time to step back and design a clear framework for our courses?

In the book of Matthew, Jesus tells the parable of the wise and foolish builders:

> Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. (Matthew 7:24-27)

When we focus our initial course design efforts on creating a purposefully planned blueprint, we equip ourselves to offer TWU students an authentic, supported, and connected learning experience. In turn, students will be better prepared to weather the inevitable storms they will face as they form connections between course material and the outside world, develop their leadership skills, and strive to have a transformational impact on culture.
