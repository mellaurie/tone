What type of learning activities do you use in your courses that provide students with the opportunity to practice, to check their understanding, to self-assess or to show you where their learning gaps are?

Recall in Unit 2, formative assessment is about figuring out what students know in the midst of their learning.  This is particularly helpful information to let instructors know if they need to reteach or if they can proceed to the next topic or activity.  Formative assessments do not always have to resemble a quiz, but can be any learning activity that you can gather information from.  What work are students doing that can show you what they know?  

In the online learning environment, it may seem like this information is hard to gather and formative activities are hard to run, but that's just not true!  We have created these short videos below to demonstrate how to use different online tools that not only encourage student participation and engagement, but also provides instructors with real-time evidence of student learning.

!!! Select at least 3 videos below to view.  As you are watching, consider your course objectives and how the online tool could help you achieve them.  Also, think about what kind of formative data is generated - what does it tell you and what can you do with it?
