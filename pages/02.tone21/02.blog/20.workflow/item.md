## Course Design

When designing a course, it is important to remember that the process is ongoing. While there is no exact "right" or "wrong" way to work through the process, typically development will follow the outline below:

1. **Planning** - In this stage, the focus is on completing the course BLUEPRINT. This is a planning document that outlines details such as  the unit topics, learning outcomes, activities, assessments, and resources.
2. **Writing** - This stage involves writing/developing the content for each unit. In the Planning stage, a skeleton was developed; in this stage, we begin filling in the details of what the students will be learning.
3. **Revisions** - After writing the content, it is always a good idea to review each section and ensure that it aligns with the intended learning outcomes. Additionally, this stage provides an opportunity to identify sections of the course where activities or media resources could help to reinforce learning.
4. **Production** - This stage may look different for each course. Typically, this step involves final reviews and edits. Additionally, this stage also provides an opportunity to "personalize" the course and create a space that is unique to you and your students.

## Course Blueprint

When designing a course, the most important step involves the planning  phase. During this phase, the focus is on developing learning outcomes that are measurable. Once this has been completed, it is critical to develop learning activities and assessments that support these outcomes and align with the "flow" of the course. To do this, course designers will use a document called a *Blueprint*.

Take a look a the Blueprint template we use at TWU:

[TWU Course Blueprint Template.docx](https://mytwu.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/IDTeam/EfPUSAGXQ05AlQiXHYzAY0ABAQmhaOfzeohZhni5I8MsGA?e=MPP4Zs) (Sign-in Required)

Completing each section of this document helps to ensure that our course content, activities, and assessments all align with the outcomes to support student learning.

## Developing a Structure for Content

While Blueprint will provide framework for the development of a course, it is also important to think about how the content (or sections of the completed Blueprint) will be structured. When designing a course in an online environment, it is important to remember to be ***purposeful*** and ***intentional*** with each element of your course. It is not enough to simply upload content to Moodle and hope that students will learn it all. As an instructor, it is paramount that you consider how you structure the content so that it lends itself to the process of learning.

Ultimately, the goal of course design is to create an intuitive experience for learners where the focus is on *learning* and NOT on figuring out how to navigate your course. To achieve this, it is critical that a consistent, supportive structure that cultivates student learning is at the forefront of your course design. Investing in the Planning stage can facilitate this process.

As you think about how you are going to structure the design of your course, consider the guidelines below - each one should be incorporated into your course in a consistent manner with the focus on how it supports student learning:

### Course Overview and Introduction

- Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.
- The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.
- There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.
- Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.



### Learning Outcomes

- The course learning outcomes are measurable and reflect the course description and level of the course.
- The module/unit learning outcomes are measurable and consistent with the course-level outcomes.
- The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner’s perspective.
- There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.


### Assessment

- The assessments measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.
- Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided for the evaluation of students’ work and participation.
- The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.
- Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.
- The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.


### Instructional Materials

- The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.
- Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.
- The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.
- A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.


### Learning Activities and Learner Interaction

- Learning activities support learners in achieving the learning outcomes and completing assessments. • Learning activities provide scaffolding opportunities for building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.
- Learning activities foster student-instructor, student-content, and if appropriate to the course, student-student interaction.
- The requirements for learner interaction are clearly stated.


### Course Technology

- The technology used in the course support the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.
- Tools promote student engagement and active learning.
- Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.
- All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.
- A variety of technology is used in the course.


### Learner Support

- Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.
- Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).
- Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.


### Accessibility and Usability

- The course navigation facilitates ease of use.
- The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.
- Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.
- The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.


### TWU Values and Standards

- Learner interaction (student-instructor, student-student, student-content) promotes a sense of community aligned with Trinity Western University core values.
- Course design and instructional materials meet academic standards for Higher Education (online) learning.


### Final Thoughts

In many ways, "building" a course is no different than building a house - one does not simply put a bunch of pieces of wood together and call it a house. Designing an effective course that focuses on student learning is no different - one cannot simply "dump" content onto a page and expect students to learn.

Much like building a house, course design requires intentional thought and sequential, logical planning. First, one must consider ***who*** we are "building" the course for; next, we can begin planning ***how*** we will go about delivering a positive, intuitive learning experience (the Blueprint). As our planning evolves, we can begin to add details that will engage learners and promote learning - the Blueprint will provide a contextual overview of how each component fits together. Once we have a sense of how all the pieces work together, we can add our assessments with a sense of confidence that they align with the rest of the content in our course.

While the course design process is intended to be flexible and fluid, it is also intended to be intentional and purposeful. Laying the groundwork (Blueprint) is a critical component to ensure we have a strong foundation that cultivates an environment of learning.
