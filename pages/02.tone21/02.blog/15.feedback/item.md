# **Purposeful Feedback**

Purposeful feedback presents us with an opportunity to personalize learning. This is especially relevant in the online teaching experience when occasions to connect one-on-one with students may be few and far between. Moments of individualized teaching can occur in how we structure and present feedback.

Looking back on my own educational experience, some of the most valuable feedback I received was personalized. It was written in a way that expressed the instructors genuinely cared and wanted me to succeed. Their comments went beyond providing evaluative feedback (with the goal of justifying the grade) or prescriptive feedback (“here’s how you can improve”).

These instructors sought to create a dialogue by expressing the potential they saw in my work and inviting me to become a part of the conversation. They steered clear of making imperative statements. Comments were posed as questions and asked for my input. I felt like a valued participant in the feedback process.

> “We should strive to provide feedback to students that conveys high expectations, that we believe those expectations can be achieved by the student, and that each student is included as part of the classroom culture in which we all hold each other accountable to those high expectations” (Freishtat, 2014).

Effective feedback is an ongoing process that encourages thinking instead of compliance. How can we encourage learners to engage with the feedback itself? What are some strategies to make feedback reciprocal? Approaches can include self and peer-assessment, one-on-one conferences, and opportunities to revise work based on the feedback received.

> “We learn most when someone else pays attention to what’s working within us and asks us to cultivate it intelligently” (Buckingham & Goodall, 2019).

This is not to suggest that feedback should focus more on the individual instead of assessment criteria. However, I do think that we can use students’ work itself as a catalyst to engage, motivate, and build confidence. **The key here is to explain what worked for you in that moment and what you experienced** (i.e. “here’s how I interpreted this section” or “when reading this, I immediately connected it to your earlier example about…”).

> “Those are your reactions—they are your truth—and when you relay them in specific detail, you aren’t judging or rating or fixing [the student]; you’re simply reflecting…the unique “dent” [they] just made in the world, as seen through your eyes. And precisely because it isn’t a judgment or a rating it is at once more humble and more powerful” (Buckingham & Goodall, 2019).

Take a moment to watch the video in the following learning activity and consider how you might apply it to your own feedback approach.

!!! Reflect on the following questions:  
!!! 1. What do you think about the “pacing tool” Renniger mentions as a method for getting students ready to receive feedback? Would this step work better while giving video/audio feedback (for instance, through the Poodll plugin?), or can we incorporate it into written comments as well?  
!!! Renniger states,   
!!! > “Great feedback givers wrap their message in a question…[the] conversation is no longer a monologue, but rather joint problem-solving.”  
!!! 2. Consider the assessments in your course. Are there ample opportunities for learners to answer the questions posed in your feedback? Can they apply the feedback you’ve given them in subsequent formative and summative assessments?

Feedback that is both timely and consists of ongoing dialogue with students might sound like a lot, especially if you are teaching multiple classes. Instructor burnout is real, and we should address it. In her book, *Small Teaching Online* (2019), Flower Darby discusses “the power of multistep engagement throughout an assessment in helping students find it meaningful” (p.31). I would argue that multistep *feedback* is inherent in this approach.

Brief and informal feedback is an effective way to address misconceptions early. Gentle correction in response to low-stakes assessment throughout the course can mitigate the amount of feedback instructors feel they have to provide near the end of the term. Similarly, rewrites/resubmissions do not have be an arduous marking task. Here, instructors can make use of low-stakes assessments or online testing that allows for multiple attempts. You might also consider group-feedback sessions, where students take on the role of teachers. In this type of peer-assessment, students use the assignment's rubric to assess each other’s work.

The evaluative language that characterizes much of the feedback we give, coupled with the looming presence of the grade itself can be intimidating for many students. Frequent opportunities for participation in the feedback process allows students to shape their own learning. It invites them to be apart of classroom culture and engage with the language surrounding assessment.
