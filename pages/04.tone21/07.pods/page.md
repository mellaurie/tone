## Developing Community in a Multi-Access Course

In order to build a Community of Reflection and Practice (the TOnE CORP), we encourage you to connect with a partner/group where you can support each other, discuss course design ideas, and collaborate. Here is a structure we will use in this course and which you are encouraged to replicate in your own courses.

#### Learning Partners

Each learner should identify one learning partner who will be their first contact when they have a question about the `logistics` of the course and expectations from the instructor. Your learning partner will be your 'go-to' person for all sorts of questions about due dates, assignment instructions, procedures, where to find resources, etc.

#### Learning Pods

Each set of learning partners will also connect with another set of learning partners to form a learning pod. Learning pods should meet regularly outside of our scheduled meeting times to discuss the course `content`. This is an opportunity for peer review of your individual work, questions about difficult concepts, and other content-related items.

!! See [Learning Pod Discussion Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvj6SC3-OL1xZXKG53fMUsDTL8CnvoMxcdmbVcD8SWs) as a guide.

#### Rationale
One of the common complaints about remote learning is that both learners and faculty feel very isolated and alone. It is important to provide some structure to encourage learner-learner interactions. Faculty who have used this strategy report that comments show up in end of course 'evaluations' that learners, for the first time in their degree, made a friend because of this course structure. Social connections are critical for many learners. Furthermore, encouraging learners to review each others' work is a cognitive task that encourages deep approaches to learning.
