Nice work!

The internet is full of serendipitous surprises, and you should take advantage of that. Use links in your course materials to extend understanding, provide context, and promote curiosity.

If you have an image you'd like to share, send me a link and I'll add it as a header to one of our pages along with credit, of course.
